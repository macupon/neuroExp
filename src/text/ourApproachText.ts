    "description": "Child-led therapy is all about following a child's interests and allowing them to lead in your sessions. Rather than going into sessions with an adult-directed agenda, we enter the child’s world of play. Children will gravitate toward what they enjoy or what their body needs (jumping, crashing, etc). This means sessions are intrinsically motivating and meaningful for the child. This doesn’t mean that we have to use the same activities/toys in the same way every session or that we can never introduce anything new. Child-led therapy allows us to establish ourselves as a true play partner and form authentic relationships with the child that are built on trust and connection. Trust is foundational for our language models to be accepted by children."

    "description": "Analytic language development and gestalt language development are two ways of processing and developing language. Many people think of analytic language development as the standard method for developing language, using words as a basis for producing sentences. Children who use gestalt language development process language in whole sections rather than singular words at first. Both analytic language development and gestalt language development are normal and natural! (Ann Peters, 1983)."

    "description": "Sensory regulation serves as the cornerstone for successful interaction and communication. When individuals are able to regulate their sensory experiences, they can better manage their attention, emotions, and responses to stimuli in their environment. This regulation lays the foundation for effective communication by enabling individuals to focus, process information, and engage with others without being overwhelmed or distracted by sensory input."

    "description": "AAC stands for Augmentative and Alternative Communication and encompasses a wide range of tools and strategies designed to support individuals with communication difficulties, ranging from speech-generating devices to picture communication systems and sign language. For parents, embracing AAC often begins with understanding its potential to unlock their child's ability to express thoughts, feelings, and desires. It's a journey of learning about different AAC options, exploring how they can be integrated into daily life, and discovering the profound impact they can have on their child's social interactions, academic progress, and overall quality of life. By embracing AAC, parents embark on a path of advocacy and empowerment, ensuring that their child's voice is heard and valued, regardless of their verbal abilities."
